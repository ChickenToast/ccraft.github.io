   <b><h1 id = "bcf">Chapter 1: Badcraft's fall</h1></b>
    <p id = "bcc">Badcraft was falling apart. There was a crap ton of downtime that started on the 20th of May, spanning until May 23rd. When it came back on, the tps was at 11-15 constantly. Making it barely playable and just a short while after he announced he was going to let someone buy the server. If I remember correctly the price was 100$ for the plugins + world file. It was going to be on for a week and it was unsure if even that was going to last. What had been around Badcraft's peak player-base (around 20+ players every day) was now at 1-3 at peak hours.
Nobody wanted to do anything, people who donated felt betrayed and it was a mess.
We started kind of joking around about hosting Badcraft in the chat and we eventually made a planning-server on discord. Talking about prices. Eventually the CCraft discord server was made and we tried evacuating people to it.
Out of nowhere Shieldtrain decided to flip the off-switch on the discord server. Leaving what player base we had now stuck on CCraft.

<b><h1 id = "rd">Chapter 2: World Corruption</h1></b>
<p id = "rdt">On 21/07/2020, dullstaples messaged on the supporter chat "As supporters i feel as if you guys should know this news first but there is a possibility of the world file corrupting. I will make this announcement soon but I feel it is necessary to get people to prepare.
@Supporter @Early Supporter
Nylon (server host) is trying his hardest to fix this." Later he did post it in the #announcements, but most were pretty ok with it. Pyoreys and The Red Death had left, since they debated quitting anyways. (Later on they will return). On the next day the server stopped for the last try of recovering world's files, but unfortunately, it was lost forever. The reason was sudden windows update.</p>

<b><h1 id = "bd">Chapter 3: Backdoor Drama</h1></b>
<p id = "bdt">On 12/08/2020, dullstaples posts this: "Hey guys some crazy stuff went down. Servers gonna be down for a bit. Itll be up in a little.", "EST DOWNTIME: 3-6 Hours" which resulted in many people thinking of 2nd reset. Which was false. Later on, Nylontent posts "We got hacked bruh", as well as dull posts "Console was hacked into. Anyways I am very sorry for this. World files are safe and all data is secure now. Thank you for being patient with us.". The console was hacked because dullstaples downloaded a trojan that his own bot spammed in peoples dms.</p>

<p id = "ccrt">Admins integrated new feature - creator rank. You get if you will make videos/stream regularly. Warren started to stream, as well as me started this particular project and my channel. The server began to grow like crazy and if it was 5-10 online during peak hours and 17 was the record, now its nearly 15 players during peak, as well as 31 players as a record! The server still grows, and a new computer will arrive shortly. Stay tuned!</p>
